# Adapter Design Pattern
This repository contains code that implements the adapter design pettern.
Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
The adapter is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.
An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. The wrapped object isnâ€™t even aware of the adapter.
